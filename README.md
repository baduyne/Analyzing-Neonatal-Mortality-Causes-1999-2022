#  Welcome to Our Project: Analyzing Neonatal Mortality Causes (1999–2022)

##  Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze **factors related to mothers and the causes of neonatal mortality** during the period from **1999 to 2022**. Based on the findings, we aim to draw valuable insights and provide recommendations for expectant parents to reduce risks during pregnancy and improve neonatal health outcomes.
